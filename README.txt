# Summary

Traffic cone for dual color extrusion.  

Here's a video:

# Instructions

Print the model in white and orange.  
I don't know if the gcode is any good since there's no control over dual extrusion models in ReplicatorG.  
@ Makerbot, please add some sort of control to ReplicatorG such that the user is able to see both models at the same time. Otherwise it's pretty much impossible to check the relative position of them.  
Update:  
I uploaded an improved design (files: "..._Rings_Orange.stl" and "..._Rings_White.stl") in which the parts of each color are disjoint. I used OpenSTL from Wei Li to merge the disjoint parts for each color together since this cannot be made with Creo Elements Express.
